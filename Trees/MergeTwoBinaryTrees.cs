 #region Question
// Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, 
//some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
// You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, 
//then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
//For Execution: (copy & paste below lines in Main method)
// var merge = new MergeTwoBinaryTrees();
// var mergedTree = merge.MergeTrees(tree1.GetRoot(),tree3.GetRoot());
// Tree tree = new Tree();
// Console.WriteLine("Merged Tree:");
// tree.PreOrderTraversal(mergedTree);
